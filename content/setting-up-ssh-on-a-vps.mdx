SSH lets you safely connect to your VPS. It’s useful for running commands, updating files, and deploying apps. Here’s how to set it up.

## Connect to Your VPS

When you get a VPS, your provider will usually send:

- An IP address (e.g. `192.0.2.123`)
- A `root` username
- A password or preloaded SSH key

To connect:

```bash
ssh root@192.0.2.123
````

If prompted about the authenticity of the host, type `yes`.

---

## Create a New User

Running everything as `root` is dangerous. Create a user with sudo rights:

```bash
adduser yourname
usermod -aG sudo yourname
```

Switch to the new user:

```bash
su - yourname
```

---

## Set Up SSH Keys

On your **local machine**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
```

Then send your key to the VPS:

```bash
ssh-copy-id yourname@192.0.2.123
```

If needed, manually copy your public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to the server into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Make sure permissions are strict:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

## Harden SSH Configuration

Edit the SSH server config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Recommended changes:

```text
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Then restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

## Test Before You Close

Do not log out yet, open a new terminal and test:

```bash
ssh yourname@192.0.2.123
```

Make sure you can log in before closing the root session.

---

## Change Default Port

For a bit of extra stealth, change the default SSH port (22):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set:

```text
Port 2222
```

Restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Then connect like this:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 yourname@192.0.2.123
```

---

Your VPS is now set up with SSH and ready to use.
